2018-09-26,23:00,0.000507125873507,0.242552210887, Using an ImageDataGenerator with featurewise_std_normalization/featurewise_center/Vertical Flip all set to True., "Car immdediately turning left and halting before turning right and going off road. Also, since test error is low and validation is relatively high, model is likely overfitting."
